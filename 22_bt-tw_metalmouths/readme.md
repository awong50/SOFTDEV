* Built in responsiveness to various screen sizes

* Built in responsiveness to various screen sizes
* Built in JS to the framework for dropdowns and cool effects
* Navbar condenses into a button that shows a dropdown when screen is changed size (cool feature)


## QCC: 

### TAILWIND
* Tailwind paywall makes it less accessible than other CSS tools
* There is a lack of built in JS functionality, so it would be supplemented by custom or other framework code
