## DISCO
- requests.get() simplifies fetching and parsing JSON responses compared to urllib.request
- json.loads() converts JSON strings to Python and json.dumps() does the reverse
- had to decode raw bytes using .decode('utf-8') to convert to a readable string

## QCC
- How are API rate limits/errors handled?
- key_nasa.txt is required for the program to run, is there a way to share a key without making it viewable by everyone?
