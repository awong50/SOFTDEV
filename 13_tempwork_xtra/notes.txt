Noteable Notes:
1. Easier to store resources and weights in a dictionary for clarity and efficency (Super helpful that dictionary finds key values in constant time)
2. Jinja2 makes it easy to fuse HTML and variables
3. target="_blank" allows you to make a link open in a new tab when it is clicked

EGO:
1. Since a programmer can reach many roadblocks in the process of creating a program, they are more likely to stumble on a problem that they feel they cannot solve on their own. This is where teamwork comes to play, as it is helpful to ask others to try to identify the issue. However, when assistance is requested and given in a more formal enviornment, they are often slower and not as effective. This is why informal social structures develop, as it makes it easy to communicate with coworkers at any time with more comfort. In my experience, I feel that work is quicker if I am in a group that uses direct messaging, which is a more informal method of communication, rather than email, which is a more formal method of communication. In addition, when using direct messaging, the time frames that we can bounce ideas are longer, and extend past normal business hours. 

3. I often find myself refering to my work as my program. However, I think that is due to a lack of other words to describe a program (as saying a program I wrote takes longer).

4. I don't often blame others for errors in my program because I was the one who wrote it at the end of the day. However, I do find myself being more aggressive with my possessions when I have a lot of trouble solving an error.

5. I rarely blame "bad luck" as the source of my errors. I usually call myself dumb and move on.
