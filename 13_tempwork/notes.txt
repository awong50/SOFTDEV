Noteable Notes:
1. Easier to store resources and weights in a dictionary for clarity and efficency (Super helpful that dictionary finds key values in constant time)
2. Jinja2 makes it easy to fuse HTML and variables
3. target="_blank" allows you to make a link open in a new tab when it is clicked

EGO:
